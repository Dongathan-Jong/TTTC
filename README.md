# TTTC - Made for Scrapyard by Hack Club
The Trash Talking Trash Can... the garbage can that treats you like garbage!

Uses an Arduino, 3 servos, a bluetooth speaker, and a push button! 

When the user tries to press the button, it is impossible to press the button, and one the user does find a workaround, if trash is thrown into it, it will trash talk you!
